# CS50 Projects

This repository contains my solutions and final project from [CS50 – Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's introductory course in computer science.

Each subfolder corresponds to a problem set (pset) or the final project, implemented using C, Python, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript depending on the problem requirements.

## 🔧 Problem Sets

### 🧱 `mario`
A simple C program that generates a pyramid of hashes like Super Mario. Includes `mario.c` in both **mario-less** and **mario-more** versions.

### 🔐 `caesar`
